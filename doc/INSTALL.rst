Setup/Installation
------------------

This part of the Shumlib documentation details the build process from the
perspective of a user: how to build Shumlib so that you can start using it in
your applications.  For a greater level of detail and information on
*developing* Shumlib itself see the developer information (develop.rst).

Prerequisites
*************

 - Either "make" or any tool supporting standard make syntax (e.g. "gmake").

 - A Fortran compiler capable of (at least) the 2003 standard. It should also
   support the extensions from the ISO/IEC TS 29113:2012 standard on further
   interoperability of Fortran with C (or Fortran 2018 or later, when these
   extentions become part of the main standard).

 - A C compiler capable of (at least) the c99 standard.

 - A method to pre-process fortran source files is also required for some
   libraries.

Configuration files
*******************

Building Shumlib first requires a suitable make configuration file; to define
the tools, compilers and flags for your platform/architecture. Sites where the
UM is routinely built have their own sets of these configurations in the
toplevel ``make`` directory, and these files are named (by convention):

.. parsed-literal::

    <site_identifier>-<platform>-<fortran_compiler>-<c_compiler>.mk

So for example the file ``meto-x86-ifort-gcc.mk`` is a configuration for a
standard Linux system at the UK Met Office using the Intel Fortran compiler and
GNU C compiler. If you are building Shumlib at a UM partner site you may find a
configuration for your site already exists, otherwise you can create a new file
or try using an existing file that appears to be a close match for your own
platform/architecture.

Either way the existing configuration files are liberally commented to indicate
what each value represents - making any of them a good starting point to base
your own file on. You should assume that all of the available values must be
defined (but some may be left blank).

Running Make
************

Once you have a suitable configuration file, you can build the libraries by
passing the file to make, e.g.

.. parsed-literal::

    make -f <configuration> [library_name(s)]

Where ``<configuration>`` gives the full path to the configuration file you wish
to use for the build, and ``library_name`` refers to one or more of the library
sub-directories starting with ``shum_*`` (e.g. ``shum_wgdos_packing``).  Note
that these trailing arguments are optional - if you omit them the default
behaviour will be to compile all available libraries. Otherwise only named
libraries *and any libraries on which they depend* will be compiled (so for
instance if the argument ``shum_wgdos_packing`` is passed this will also compile
``shum_string_conv``, since the packing library makes use of it).

So for example, to compile the WGDOS packing library and its dependent
libraries using the ``meto-x86-ifort-gcc`` config you would run the command:

.. parsed-literal::

    make -f make/meto-x86-ifort-gcc.mk shum_wgdos_packing


Build Location
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

If the build is successful the output will appear (by default) in the folder
``build/<platform>`` where ``<platform>`` is the value of the ``PLATFORM`` variable
set at the end of the configuration file (by convention this is the same as the
configuration filename without the ``.mk`` extension).

You can control the build destination using the following environment variables:

 - ``LIBDIR_ROOT``: this sets the base directory for the install (i.e. not
   including the ``<platform>`` part above, which will be appended as a
   subdirectory); the default for this is ``$PWD/build``.

 - ``LIBDIR_OUT``: this sets the *entire* directory for the install (i.e. the
   value of ``<platform>`` above will be disregarded and your exact name will
   be used); the default for this is ``$LIBDIR_ROOT/$PLATFORM``.

You can also control the build source using the following environment variables:

 - ``ROOT_DIR``: this sets the root directory, from which all the makefile paths are
   relative. This allows the makefile to build from an alternative working copy of
   the Shumlib source. The default for this variable is ``$PWD``.

FRUIT Testing
%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Shumlib also includes a series of unit-tests, to confirm that the runtime
behaviour of the libraries is as expected.

To build and run the tests for a specific library, you must run make with the
tests you wish to run as arguments. The names of the tests are given as the
``library_name`` they apply to, appended with ``_tests``. You may specify more
than one test at a time; e.g:

.. parsed-literal::

  make -f <configuration> <library_name>_tests [<library_name2>_tests ...]

This will compile the specified libraries and their dependencies as required.
Following this it will compile the unit tests for the specified libraries.

To execute the tests you have just built, you can use either the ``test`` or
``run_tests`` targets. This will compile the FRUIT driver (FRUIT is an external
unit testing framework distributed with Shumlib) and execute the tests, displaying
the results.

.. parsed-literal::

  make -f <configuration> run_tests

You will notice that the test output appears twice - this is because each library is
also built twice; once as a dynamic library and once as a static library, and
these are tested separately.

(The difference between the ``test`` and ``run_tests`` targets, is that ``test`` will
first attempt to compile any available tests from previously built libraries, whereas
``run_tests`` will only execute pre-built tests.)

Alternatively, if you wish to build and run *all* of the available tests, you can run do
so in a single step with the ``check`` make target; e.g:

.. parsed-literal::

  make -f <configuration> check

This will build all the libraries, their dependencies, their unit tests
and the FRUIT driver as required. It will then execute and display the tests as
above.

Note that not *all* the libraries within Shumlib will necessarily have tests. If
this is the case for a given library, it will still be compiled, although it won't
be verified or displayed within the fruit output.

Note also, that any additional environment variables passed to the initial build
must also be passed to the above commands (e.g. if you specified an alternative
``LIBDIR_OUT`` you should specify it again for the testing). This is true
regardless of if you are running an individual test, or all of them using the
``check`` target.

As an example, to compile and run the WGDOS packing library unit tests using the
``meto-x86-ifort-gcc`` config you would run the command:

.. parsed-literal::

    make -f make/meto-x86-ifort-gcc.mk shum_wgdos_packing_tests test

Cleanup
%%%%%%%

Like most make-based systems you may pass commands to either remove *all* build
output, or only intermediate build output (e.g. object files).  Note that since
the paths depend on the configuration files these must still be specified, and
in the case of cleaning the build output, only the specified configuration
output will be cleaned.  The make targets are invoked as follows:

 - ``make -f <configuration> clean``: to completely remove *all* build output
   including the produced libraries and test executables.

 - ``make -f <configuration> clean-temp``: to *only* remove intermediate files but
   leave the build output itself in place.

OpenMP Control
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

By default Shumlib will try to build libraries with OpenMP support enabled
(assuming the compiler and configuration file support the flags
correctly). This will require the same OpenMP flags to be provided to the linker
when building an application that links against a Shumlib library. For
convenience the inclusion of the OpenMP flags can be toggled using the
environment variable ``SHUM_OPENMP``.  If set to "false" the resulting build will
not include the OpenMP flags specified in the configuration file.

In the case where you require *both* an OpenMP and no-OpenMP build you can use
this option in conjunction with the build location options (see above) to
produce multiple output directories.  For instance suppose we are building
multiple libraries for and wish to install to a non-default location:

.. parsed-literal::

    export LIBDIR_OUT=/home/wilfred/shumlib/openmp
    export SHUM_OPENMP=true
    make -f <configuration>
    make -f <configuration> clean-temp

    export LIBDIR_OUT=/home/wilfred/shumlib/no-openmp
    export SHUM_OPENMP=false
    make -f <configuration>
    make -f <configuration> clean-temp

This would produce the libraries twice, allowing including applications to link
to the appropriate version depending on their own OpenMP status.

Preprocessed options
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Some libraries may contain pre-processed options. Shumlib should build sucessfully
with the defaults provided by the makefile. However, ocassionally users may wish to
select specific options from the command line for portability and/or performance
reasons. In these cases, the default options can be overridden with environment
variables. These environment valiables can be set either to true or false.

The currently supported options (environment variables) are:

 - ``SHUM_HAS_IEEE_ARITHMETIC``: if true, allows the build to make use of
   functionality from the intrinsic ``IEEE_ARITHMETIC`` Fortran module.

 - ``SHUM_EVAL_NAN_BY_BITS``: if true, forces the interrogation of the sepcial NaN
   (not a number) floating-point value to be done by bit-wise inspection methods.
   This will override other methods, such as ``IEEE_ARITHMETIC`` functionality even
   if it would otherwise be availible.

 - ``SHUM_EVAL_DENORMAL_BY_BITS``: if true, forces the interrogation of special
   denormal floating-point values to be done by bit-wise inspection methods. This
   will override other methods, such as ``IEEE_ARITHMETIC`` functionality even
   if it would otherwise be availible.


Similarly to how multiple versions of shumlib could be build with differing OpenMP
options above, we can select different pre-processing options for different builds
too:

.. parsed-literal::

    export LIBDIR_OUT=/home/wilfred/shumlib/ieee_arithmetic
    export SHUM_HAS_IEEE_ARITHMETIC=true
    make -f <configuration>
    make -f <configuration> clean-temp

    export LIBDIR_OUT=/home/wilfred/shumlib/bitwise_eval
    export SHUM_HAS_IEEE_ARITHMETIC=false
    export SHUM_EVAL_NAN_BY_BITS=true
    export SHUM_EVAL_DENORMAL_BY_BITS=true
    make -f <configuration>
    make -f <configuration> clean-temp

Group/Site Make Scripts
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

You can also find bash scripts which handle (and provide traceability for) the
entire set of builds for a given site, in the ``scripts`` directory.

Taking the Met Office script as an example, it consists of a series of
commands that build Shumlib using different combinations of compilers with
appropriate setup commands to provide the correct environments, as well as
producing both OpenMP and non-OpenMP variants.  A script like this may well
be overkill for smaller installations.
