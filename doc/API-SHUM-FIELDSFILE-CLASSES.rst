API Reference: UM File and Field classes
----------------------------------------

This API is **experimental**; it provides a higher-level way of reading and
writing fieldsfiles over the functions provided in ``shum_fieldsfile``. There
are three classes provided, ``shum_file_type`` which represents a fieldsfile (or
UM start dump), and  ``shum_field_type``, which represents a UM field.

The third class is ``shum_ff_status_type``, which is returned by methods in the
other two classes:

Public Variables: ``shum_ff_status_type``
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

As well as providing the variables detailed below, this module also has
overloaded operators for ``==``, ``>``, ``<``, ``>=``, ``<=`` and ``/=`` to
allow the ``icode`` inside the status object to be compared with a raw integer,
or with other status objects, e.g. ``IF (status /= 0_int64)`` is equivalent
to ``IF (status%icode /= 0_int64)``.


``icode (shum_ff_status_type)``

An integer return code from the method. This will be zero for success; a
non-zero value indicates an issue. In cases where there is a distinction
between a warning and a fatal error, warnings have a negative icode and
errors positive icode.


``message (CHARACTER(LEN=1024)``
If the icode of this object is non-zero, this should contain a message
describing what the issue was.



Public Variables: ``shum_file_type``
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

``fields (shum_field_type array)``

This is an ALLOCATABLE array of ``shum_field_type`` objects, corresponding to the
fields present in the file.


``num_fields (64-bit INTEGER)``

This contains the total number of fields currently in the file.


Fortran Methods (Functions): ``shum_file_type``
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

``open_file``
'''''''''''''

This function opens a fieldsfile (or UM start dump). By default, an existing
file is opened read-only.

    **Available via class**
        ``shum_file_type``

    **Syntax**
        ``icode = um_file%open_file(filename, num_lookups, overwrite)``

    **Inputs**
        ``filename (CHARACTER)``
            The path to the filename.

        ``num_lookup (optional 64-bit INTEGER)``
            The number of empty lookup entries to create. If not set, this
            defaults to 4096, as per the FieldsFile standard.

        ``overwrite (optional LOGICAL)``
            If set to true, this method will overwrite existing files rather
            than open them as read-only.

    **Return Value**
        ``status (shum_ff_status_type)``
            Exit status; ``0`` means success, anything else means an error has
            occurred and in that case the ``message`` variable in the object
            will contain information about the problem.



``read_header``
'''''''''''''''

This function reads the header from a previously-opened file. It also populates
the file with field objects corresponding to each field (without loading the
actual data).

    **Available via class**

    **Syntax**
        ``icode = um_file%read_header()``

        ``status (shum_ff_status_type)``
            Exit status; ``0`` means success, anything else means an error has
            occurred and in that case the ``message`` variable in the object
            will contain information about the problem.


``read_field``
''''''''''''''

This function reads in the data for a specified field in the file. The data
will be available using ``um_file%fields(field_number)%get_data``.

    **Available via class**
        ``shum_file_type``

    **Syntax**

    **Return Value**
        ``status (shum_ff_status_type)``
            Exit status; ``0`` means success, anything else means an error has
            occurred and in that case the ``message`` variable in the object
            will contain information about the problem.


``write_header``
''''''''''''''''

This function writes the header information in the ``shum_file_type`` object to
disk. Note that actually writing certain header components may be deferred
until the file is closed.

    **Available via class**

            will contain information about the problem.


``write_field``

This function writes the specified data to disk. Packing is controlled by the
**LBPACK** lookup value. Note that to write land- or sea-compressed data, the
land-sea mask must already exist in the file.

for example:

  ``icode = um_file%read_field(found_field_indices(1_int64))``

  ``icode = um_file%get_field(found_field_indices(1_int64), local_field)``

where ``found_field_indices`` is a list of indices matching the criteria and
``local_field`` is a field of type ``shum_field_type``. In this case the field

            If present, the found fields must match this LBPROC value. This
            corresponds to the LBPROC value in the lookup.

        ``fctime (optional 64-bit REAL)``

            corresponds to the LBPROC value in the lookup.


        ``fctime (optional 64-bit REAL)``
            If present, the found fields must match this forecast time within a
            certain tolerance. This is the timespan in hours between the data
            and validity time. It is **NOT** the LBFT value, which is an

            the object will contain further information.

``set_filename``
''''''''''''''''

``set_lookup``

This function sets the lookup of a field. It additionally generates the REAL
representation of the forecast time, as the value in the lookup (LBFT) is an

longitudes and latitudes of the field; variable-resolution grids set these with
``set_longitudes`` and ``set_latitudes`` instead (which should be done
automatically when ``read_header`` is called on an existing variable resolution
file).
