API Reference: shum_number_tools
--------------------------------

There are certain special classes of number which may be encountered when
working with floating point arithmatic. These are "NaN" (not a number),
"Inf" (infinities), and "denormal" (too small to be represented) numbers.

The intrisinc IEEE arithmetic module provides some functions to query these
classes of number, but unfortunatly compiler support accross different
architectures is incomplete.

Even when the IEEE functions are availible, they sometimes do not work on
accelerator architectures. For example, there are known examples of systems
which support ``ieee_is_nan`` correctly on a host CPU, but this does not
function correctly when offloaded to a GPU.

This library therefore provides abstract tests which are portable across
systems even when the IEEE arithmetic module is not availible, and which
also work on accerators.

All of these tests work with both positive and negative variants of inputs.
That is to say if, for example, ``f_shum_is_inf(number)`` is ``.TRUE.``,
then ``f_shum_is_inf(-number)`` is also ``.TRUE.``.
