Shumlib Documentation
=====================

What is Shumlib?
----------------

Shumlib is the collective name for a set of libraries which are used by the UM;
the UK Met Office's Unified Model, that may be of use to external tools or
applications where identical functionality is desired. The hope of the project
is to enable developers to quickly and easily access parts of the UM code that
are commonly duplicated elsewhere, at the same time benefiting from any
improvements or optimisations that might be made in support of the UM itself.

Shumlib Licensing
-----------------

Although the UM has a restricted commercial licence, code that is moved into
Shumlib has been assessed and re-classified under the more permissive BSD
3-Clause licence. The aim of this is to allow maximum flexibility and as few
barriers to usage as possible. However we would still encourage the feedback of
modifications and developments (particularly bugfixes) rather than modified
redistribution.

About this Documentation
------------------------

This documentation is split into a few different sections.  An
installation/build guide which details how to configure and build Shumlib
(``INSTALL.rst``), a series of API Reference guides which describe the exposed
interfaces for each library (``API-SHUM-\*.rst``), and a Developer's Guide which
contains more in-depth information for developers of Shumlib itself
(``DEVELOP.rst``). Additionally, there are some technical papers
(``TECHNICAL-\*.rst``) which go into more in-depth technical detail about
some aspects of Shumlib, which are not necessarily required knowledge for all
developers or users.
