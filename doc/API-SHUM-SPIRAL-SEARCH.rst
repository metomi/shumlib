``get_shum_spiral_search_version``
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

All Shumlib libraries expose a module and function named in this format; it
allows access to the Shumlib version number used when compiling the library.

    **Available via module**
        ``f_shum_spiral_search_version_mod``

    **Syntax**
        ``version = get_shum_spiral_search_version()``

    **Returns**
        ``version (INTEGER)``
            Shumlib version number, in format ``YYYYMMX`` (the 4-digit year
            followed by 2-digit month and an additional digit signifying the
            release count within that specified month).


``f_shum_spiral_search_algorithm``
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

This function calculates values for unresolved points.
using a spiral search method, which finds the closest point by distance (in m)
Method: Uses the Haversine formula to calculate the distances.
Searches in steps of 3*minimum local distance for each unresolved point until
it finds a resolved point. For land points in a field that is not "land only"
a 200km constraint is applied - if there is no resolved land point within
this distance, it uses the closest resolved sea point value instead.
For Global (cyclic) domains, if hit an edge it calculates the distances of
every point in the domain as it can't cope with looping over the edges.
This will cause the scheme to take much longer to run, however this is unlikely
to happen often.

It is used in the Unified Model's reconfiguration for consistency of some
ancillary file fields with the land-sea mask.

            True if constraining spiral search.

            Adjusts the distance step size of the iterations done whilst searching.
        ``cyclic_domain (LOGICAL, KIND=C_BOOL, scalar)``
            True if grid has cyclic (wraparound) edges.
        ``unres_mask (LOGICAL, KIND=C_BOOL, size=points_phi*points_lambda)``
            Mask of grid locations of points to be resolved by spiral search.

        ``cmessage (CHARACTER(LEN=*))``
            Error message buffer.

    **Return Value**
        ``status (INTEGER)``
            Exit status; ``0`` means success, anything else means an error has
            occurred, in which case the ``message`` argument will contain
            information about the problem.

    **Notes**
        The arguments here must be either *all* 32-bit or *all* 64-bit
        (but *not* a mixture of the two) and logicals must be kind=C_BOOL.

Unified Model Implementation
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

This shumlib function replaces the spiral circle search subroutine
``SPIRAL_CIRCLE_SEARCH`` called in subroutine ``rcf_spiral_circle_s``.
In the Unified Model the shumlib function is invoked through a module
E.g.
``USE hum_spiral_search_mod, ONLY: f_shum_spiral_search_algorithm``
while the logicals require
``USE , INTRINSIC :: ISO_C_BINDING, ONLY: C_BOOL``.
