``get_shum_fieldsfile_version``
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

All Shumlib libraries expose a module and function named in this format; it
allows access to the Shumlib version number used when compiling the library.

    **Available via module**
        ``f_shum_fieldsfile_version_mod``

    **Syntax**
        ``version = get_shum_fieldsfile_version()``

    **Returns**
        ``version (64-bit INTEGER)``
            Shumlib version number, in format ``YYYYMMX`` (the 4-digit year
            followed by 2-digit month and an additional digit signifying the
            release count within that specified month).

``f_shum_open_file``
''''''''''''''''''''

This function is used to open an existing FieldsFile (or variant thereof) - see
the routine ``f_shum_create_file`` for creating a new file.

    **Available via module**
        ``f_shum_fieldsfile_mod``

    **Syntax**
        ``status = f_shum_open_file(filename, ff_id, message)``

    **Inputs**
        ``filename (CHARACTER)``
            The path to the filename (which must already exist).

    **Outputs**
        ``ff_id (64-bit INTEGER)``
            A value which acts as an identifier for the file, the value
            itself is arbitrary but must be passed to all other operations
            which need to reference the file opened here.

    **Input & Output**
        ``message (CHARACTER(LEN=*))``
            Error message buffer.

    **Return Value**
        ``status (64-bit INTEGER)``
            Exit status; ``0`` means success, anything else means an error has
            occurred and in that case the ``message`` argument will contain
            information about the problem.

``f_shum_create_file``
''''''''''''''''''''''

This function is used to create a new FieldsFile (or variant thereof) - see
the routine ``f_shum_open_file`` for opening an existing file.

        ``overwrite (optional LOGICAL)``
            Determines whether the presence of an existing file with the given
            name should be treated as an error or not. If not provided the

    **Outputs**
        ``ff_id (64-bit INTEGER)``
            A value which acts as an identifier for the file, the value
            itself is arbitrary but must be passed to all other operations

``f_shum_read_field_data``
''''''''''''''''''''''''''

    **Available via module**
        ``f_shum_fieldsfile_mod``

    **Syntax**
        ``status = f_shum_read_field_data(ff_id, index, field_data, message, ignore_dtype)``

    **Inputs**
        ``ff_id (64-bit INTEGER)``
            The identifier for the file; this must be a value returned by an
            earlier call to ``f_shum_open_file`` or ``f_shum_create_file``.
        ``index (64-bit INTEGER)``
            Indicates the index into the lookup table containing the field data
            that should be returned.

    **Input & Output**
        ``field_data``
            The field data, a 1D ``ALLOCATABLE`` array which will become
            ``ALLOCATED`` to the correct size following the call (if it was
            already ``ALLOCATED`` it will first be ``DEALLOCATED``). The type
            of ``field_data`` may be either ``INTEGER`` or ``REAL`` and can be
            either 32-bit or 64-bit.  Which combination of these is correct
            depends on the data and packing types of the field, which you can
            determine by examining the lookup table yourself.  Passing a
            ``field_data`` array that does not match the type and precision
            indicated by the lookup will result in an error (*unless* the
            optional ``ignore_dtype`` flag is passed (see below)).
        ``message (CHARACTER(LEN=*))``
            Error message buffer.
        ``ignore_dtype (optional, LOGICAL)``
            If provided and set to true (default if not provided is false) the
            type and precision of the ``field_data`` variable will be used
            regardless of what the lookup specifies. This means that for example
            a field which should be 64-bit ``REAL`` data can be read into a
            32-bit ``INTEGER`` array (as raw bytes; to retrieve the true
            ``REAL`` values later each pair of values would need to be combined
            and then changed into a ``REAL`` representation using ``TRANSFER``)

    **Return Value**
        ``status (64-bit INTEGER)``
            Exit status; ``0`` means success, anything above ``0`` means an
            error has occurred, and a value of ``-1`` means this component was
            not present in the file.  In both unsuccessful cases the ``message``
            argument will contain further information.

            The identifier for the file; this must be a value returned by an
            earlier call to ``f_shum_open_file`` or ``f_shum_create_file``.
        ``fixed_length_header (64-bit INTEGER)``
            The fixed length header (always a 1D array with exactly
            256 elements).

    **Input & Output**
        ``message (CHARACTER(LEN=*))``
            Error message buffer.

    **Return Value**
        ``status (64-bit INTEGER)``
            Exit status; ``0`` means success, anything else means an error has
            occurred and in that case the ``message`` argument will contain
            information about the problem.

    **Notes**
        Unlike many of the other routines, no writing to disk actually takes
        place upon calling this command.  The fixed length header is committed
        to disk when the file is closed.  Also note that any positional
        elements of the fixed length header passed here are discarded (as the
        API will ensure positional elements always reflect the written
        structure of the file).

``f_shum_write_lookup``
'''''''''''''''''''''''

This function writes the lookup table array to a file, and is intended to be
used when using the "direct" approach to writing the file (where the lookups
are written and processed prior to writing the data).

    **Available via module**
        ``f_shum_fieldsfile_mod``

    **Syntax**
        ``status = f_shum_write_lookup(ff_id, lookup, start_index, message)``

    **Inputs**
        ``ff_id (64-bit INTEGER)``
            The identifier for the file; this must be a value returned by an
            earlier call to ``f_shum_open_file`` or ``f_shum_create_file``.
        ``lookup (64-bit INTEGER)``
            The lookup (a 2D array which must have a first dimension of
            ``f_shum_lookup_dim1_len``, and a second dimension corresponding
            to the number of fields which must not exceed the number passed
            to ``f_shum_create_file``).

            of the given lookup should be written (can be used to write the
            lookup table with multiple calls; e.g. to write lookups starting
            from the 5th lookup ``start_index`` would be set to 5).

    **Input & Output**
        ``message (CHARACTER(LEN=*))``
            Error message buffer.

    **Return Value**
        ``status (64-bit INTEGER)``
            Exit status; ``0`` means success, anything else means an error has
            occurred and in that case the ``message`` argument will contain
            information about the problem.

    **Notes**
        Unlike many of the other routines, no writing to disk actually
        takes place upon calling this command.  The lookup is committed to disk
        when the file is closed.  Also note that any positional elements of the
        lookup passed here are discarded (as the API will ensure positional
        elements always reflect the written structure of the file).


``f_shum_precalc_data_positions``
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

For use when writing the file using the "direct" approach - this function scans
the lookups which have been written using ``f_shum_write_lookup`` and calculates
appropriate sizes for the positional elements (i.e. where each field's data
will begin and how much space it will take up).  Doing this allows the fields
to be written in any order.

    **Available via module**
        ``f_shum_fieldsfile_mod``

    **Syntax**
        ``status = f_shum_precalc_data_positions(ff_id, max_points, message, n_land_points, n_sea_points)``

    **Inputs**
        ``ff_id (64-bit INTEGER)``
            The identifier for the file; this must be a value returned by an
            earlier call to ``f_shum_open_file`` or ``f_shum_create_file``.
        ``max_points (64-bit INTEGER)``
            The number of 64-bit (8-byte) words which will be setup in the
            lookup table for each field.
        ``n_land_points (optional 64-bit INTEGER)``
            If provided, gives an alternative ``max_points`` value to use for
            fields designated as land-only (according to their ``LBPACK`` value).
        ``n_sea_points (optional 64-bit INTEGER)``
            If provided, gives an alternative ``max_points`` value to use for
            fields designated as sea-only (according to their ``LBPACK`` value).

    **Input & Output**
        ``message (CHARACTER(LEN=*))``
            Error message buffer.

    **Return Value**
        ``status (64-bit INTEGER)``
            Exit status; ``0`` means success, anything else means an error has
            occurred and in that case the ``message`` argument will contain
            information about the problem.


``f_shum_write_field_data``
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''

This function writes the data for a single field.  There are two different ways
to manage the writing of field data; "direct" or "sequential".  The syntax used
for this command is dependent on which of the writing methods are in use for
the given file.  A file being written via the "direct" method will have had
previous calls to ``f_shum_write_lookup`` and ``f_shum_precalc_data_positions``,
whereas a file using the "sequential" method will not.

    **Available via module**
        ``f_shum_fieldsfile_mod``

    **Syntax (Direct)**
        ``status = f_shum_write_field_data(ff_id, index, field_data, message, ignore_dtype)``
    **Syntax (Sequential)**
        ``status = f_shum_write_field_data(ff_id, lookup, field_data, message, ignore_dtype)``

    **Inputs**
        ``ff_id (64-bit INTEGER)``
            The identifier for the file; this must be a value returned by an
            earlier call to ``f_shum_open_file`` or ``f_shum_create_file``.
        ``index (64-bit INTEGER)``
            Indicates the index into the lookup table corresponding to the
            field data being passed (and where it should be written to).
        ``lookup (64-bit INTEGER)``
            The lookup of the field corresponding to the data being passed.
        ``field_data``
            The field data, a 1D array which may be either ``INTEGER`` or
            ``REAL`` and can be either 32-bit or 64-bit.  Which combination
            of these is correct depends on the data and packing types of the
            field, which should be specified in the lookup table. Passing a
            ``field_data`` array that does not match the type and precision
            indicated by the lookup will result in an error (*unless* the
            optional ``ignore_dtype`` flag is also passed (see below)).
        ``ignore_dtype (optional, LOGICAL)``
            If provided and set to true (default if not provided is false) the
            type and precision of the ``field_data`` variable will be used
            regardless of what the lookup specifies. This means that for example
            a field which should be 64-bit ``REAL`` data can be written as a
            32-bit ``INTEGER`` array (as raw bytes; to retrieve the true
            ``REAL`` values later each pair of values would need to be combined
            and then changed into a ``REAL`` representation using ``TRANSFER``)

    **Outputs**
        ``message (CHARACTER(LEN=*))``
            Error message buffer.

    **Return Value**
        ``status (64-bit INTEGER)``
            Exit status; ``0`` means success, anything else means an error has
            occurred and in that case the ``message`` argument will contain
            information about the problem.

            the given STASHmaster file will have been populated, e.g. if the
            variable ``STASHm`` contains this argument, the grid code for
            STASH code 16004 would be ``STASHm(16004) % record % grid``.

    **Outputs**

``get_shum_fieldsfile_version``
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

All Shumlib libraries expose a function named in this format; it allows access
to the Shumlib version number used when compiling the library.

    **Required header/s**
        None - always defined provided any other part of library is included.

    **Syntax**
        ``version = get_shum_fieldsfile_version()``

    **Returns**
        ``version (int)``
            Shumlib version number, in format ``YYYYMMX`` (the 4-digit year
            followed by 2-digit month and an additional digit signifying the
            release count within that specified month).
